                            <p class="col-md-6" style="font-size:11pt;">Hello! My name is Kaushal Ramalingam. 
                            I am a 14 year old student in 9th grade studying at Dublin High School. In the future, 
                            I plan on working in a field that combines the computer science field with the political
                            line, possibly as a policy analyst or an IT analyst under the government. I plan on 
                            receiving my bachelor's degree in computer science then receiving a master's degree
                            in computer engineering. I hope to attain early experience in the workforce by doing 
                            an internship in a related area in high school or in my undergraduate or graduate years.
                            I wish to work in such a field because I am extremely interested in working with software
                            and technology, and I want to be  able to contribute these skills to the government and 
                            the country.<br><br>
                            
                            I am extremely passionate in speech and debate, competing with my middle school as well
                            as participating on the Dublin High team, becoming captain of the LD division this year. I have
                            placed and received speaker awards at tournaments across the nation, most notably reaching
                            semifinals at the national tournament in Florida last year. Moreover, I love to play tennis in
                            my free time. I play competitively, taking part at tournaments across the state, and I am looking to 
                            play for the Dublin High boys tennis team in the spring. In addition, I play an active 
                            role in my community through the National Junior Honor Society. In eighth grade, I
                            was elected president of NJHS and amassed more than 70 hours of community service, from 
                            volunteering at the local homeless shelter to going door to door raising awareness about gun
                            violence.</p>
